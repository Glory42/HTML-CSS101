    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre>
Looking out the door I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So... you'll never know
Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, ya know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that
Really he has no one
So I'll wait for you, love
And I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh-oh, lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams
He had you with him
My body turns
And yearns for a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles
When I've slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh-oh-oh, lover
You should've come over, yeah, yes
Yes, I feel too young to hold on
And much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love, well I've waited for you
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, love, love, love, love, love, love!
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
    </pre>
